# Final Project: Computing Technology and Social Responsibility

### 1. Project Overview

As a culminating activity, this Final Project challenges student teams to select, investigate, and critically analyze a real or hypothetical scenario in which computing technology intersects with pressing social, ethical, or legal concerns. Students will draw from the full range of topics explored in the course—such as **ethics in computing**, **intellectual property**, **privacy**, **cybersecurity**, **digital footprints**, **environmental/health issues**, **professionalism**, **diversity/inclusion**, and **emerging technologies**—to propose actionable solutions or recommendations.

### 2. Objectives

By completing this Final Project, students should be able to:

* **Demonstrate Comprehensive Knowledge.** Apply key concepts, ethical frameworks, and professional standards covered in class to a chosen scenario.
* **Engage in Critical Analysis.** Investigate the underlying social, ethical, and technical dimensions of the scenario to identify core issues and risks.
* **Develop Feasible Solutions.** Craft recommendations or intervention strategies that address the problems identified while accounting for real-world constraints (legal, cultural, organizational, etc.).
* **Foster Collaborative Skills.** Work effectively in teams, showcasing effective communication, division of labor, and collective accountability.
* **Reflect on Professional Practice.** Consider how your solutions demonstrate professionalism, accountability, respect for privacy, inclusivity, and a commitment to ethical decision-making.

### 3. Suggested Topics or Scenarios

Teams can choose one of the sample scenarios below or propose a relevant scenario of their own (subject to instructor approval). The key requirement is that the scenario meaningfully intersects with the themes of social responsibility and professional ethics in computing.

* **Data Breach and Privacy Concerns.** A mid-sized tech company suffers a large-scale data breach, compromising user information. Analyze what went wrong, who was responsible, and propose technical, legal, and ethical steps to prevent recurrence and restore public trust.
* **AI Bias in Recruitment Software.** A startup develops an AI-powered tool to screen job applicants. Evidence emerges that the algorithm discriminates against certain demographic groups. Explore root causes (e.g., biased training data), potential lawsuits/regulations, and how to address fairness and transparency in machine learning.
* **Social Media Misinformation Campaign.** An emerging social media platform fails to mitigate the spread of fake news and conspiracy theories. Examine the impact on users, the platform’s ethical obligations, and potential policy or design changes to combat misinformation while preserving freedom of expression.
* **Overreliance on Gig Workers in a Tech Firm.** A firm that builds software for rideshare or delivery services is criticized for exploitative working conditions and lack of benefits for gig workers. Investigate the legal, ethical, and corporate social responsibility dimensions, then propose an improved model.
* **Environmental Impact of a Growing Data Center.** A technology giant expands its cloud data centers in a region with limited renewable resources, raising alarm about carbon footprints and e-waste. Evaluate sustainability concerns, community impacts, and “green computing” strategies to mitigate harm.
* **Assistive Technology and Accessibility.** A software product is used widely in education but lacks robust accessibility features for visually or hearing-impaired users. Develop a blueprint for universal design, highlight the significance of inclusivity, and recommend steps for future-proofing accessibility support.

### 4. Project Components

#### 4.1 Written Report or Analysis (60% of project grade)

**Structure**

* **Introduction and Context:** Present the chosen scenario, its relevance, and the specific social/ethical issues at stake.
* **Literature / Background Research:** Briefly review academic and industry resources that frame the problem (e.g., privacy regulations, relevant case law, professional codes of conduct, published best practices).
* **Ethical Analysis:** Apply appropriate ethical frameworks (utilitarianism, deontology, virtue ethics) or codes of conduct (ACM/IEEE) to examine the scenario’s dilemmas.
* **Discussion of Implications:** Consider potential impacts on stakeholders, including end-users, employees, shareholders, and the broader community.
* **Proposed Solutions / Recommendations:** Offer specific, actionable steps to address the issues—technical, policy, managerial, or educational.
* **Conclusion:** Summarize the project’s key findings and the rationale for your proposals, linking back to course themes.
* **References:** Include APA or IEEE-style citations for all sources consulted.

**Length**

* 10–12 pages (double-spaced), or equivalent if using alternative formats (e.g., website, interactive document). Graphs, charts, and images are encouraged where relevant.

**Depth and Quality**

* Demonstrate thorough research, critical thinking, and synthesis of course concepts.

#### 4.2 Presentation (30% of project grade)

**Format**

* In-person or online presentation, approximately **10–15 minutes** in length.
* Slide deck, live demo, or any other engaging format suitable for conveying your ideas.

### 7. Concluding Remarks

This Final Project synthesizes the ethical, social, and professional principles discussed throughout our course. It not only serves as an academic exercise but also mirrors the type of multidimensional analysis computing professionals confront in real-world scenarios. By delving into these complex issues, students hone their capacity for critical thinking, team collaboration, and ethical leadership—all traits that will define their contributions in the broader tech industry and society.
